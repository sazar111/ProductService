**ProductService â€“ Solution Document**

*Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025*

---

# 1. Overview

**ProductService** is a Spring Boot application designed for the Selfstore system to manage products and associated entities. It provides RESTful APIs for operations such as product creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. The system leverages advanced Spring features, including Spring Data JPA (ORM), Spring Security, and Redis caching (both Cloud and Local). The application follows modular and scalable design principles.

# 2. Architecture & High-Level Design

## 2.1 System Architecture

**Main Components:**
- API Gateway
- Spring Boot Application (ProductService)
- Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL with ORM)
- Redis Caching (Cloud & Local)
- Security Integration (Spring Security & UserService Authentication)
- Adapter Pattern for Redis Connectivity

# 3. Domain Model & Relationships

## 3.1 Entity-Relationship Model

| Entity        | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| Product - Category | One-to-Many |
| Product - Inventory | One-to-One |
| Order - Product | Many-to-Many |

---

# 4. Implementation Details

## 4.1 RESTful Endpoints

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| /products/{id} | GET | Retrieve product by ID |
| /products | POST | Add a new product |
| /products/{id} | PUT | Update product details |
| /products/{id} | DELETE | Remove a product |

## 4.2 Service Layer & Adapter Pattern
- **Adapter Pattern** abstracts Redis caching logic for Cloud and Local environments.

## 4.3 ORM and Data Access
- **Spring Data JPA** used for database interaction.

## 4.4 Security with Spring Security
- **JWT Token Authentication** via a security filter.

## 4.5 Multiple Redis Configurations
- **Spring Profiles** enable environment-specific Redis configurations.

---

# 5. Design Patterns Employed

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database operations.
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Provides flexibility in Redis configuration.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Ensures separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Improves maintainability and testing.

---

# 6. Testing Strategy

## 6.1 Unit Testing
- **Frameworks**: JUnit and Mockito.
- **Test Coverage**: Covers service layer and repository interactions.

## 6.2 Integration Testing
- **Focus**: Validate controllers, security, and database transactions.
- **Tools**: Spring Boot Test, TestRestTemplate.

---

# 7. Security Considerations

- **JWT Token Validation** ensures secure access.
- **Centralized Exception Handling** provides meaningful error responses.

---

# 8. Conclusion

The **ProductService** application is a secure, scalable, and well-structured solution. By leveraging Spring Boot, ORM, security mechanisms, and caching strategies, it ensures efficient product management. The usage of design patterns enhances maintainability, while comprehensive testing guarantees stability across environments.
